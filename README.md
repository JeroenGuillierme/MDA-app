# MDA-app
Python version 3.12.5

The results of the analysis from the main GitHub Repository, 'Project-MDA', were integrated into a web application. For the RTA, a dropdown menu allows users to choose between three comparison groups: vector type, province, and event level. In the AED optimization section, four sliders enable users to adjust the selected thresholds and the value of epsilon. By modifying these values, users can observe how different high-risk areas emerge or disappear and explore various clustering possibilities. The application provides a bar plot displaying the cluster sizes, a map showing the locations of interventions in high-risk areas along with their clustering, and the centroid of each cluster, which suggests potential new AED locations. At the bottom of the interface, the silhouette score is visualized to help evaluate the clustering parameters. See below for a screenshot of the app interface.
